> A bibliography generator that removes the suckiness of having to manually write bibliographies.

### How does it work?
LittList is a web application that is available to anyone at [Littlist.no](http://littlist.no). It acts like a search engine: You query for something you want to reference in your bibliography and it will respond with results. You can then add those results and LittList will automatically generate a proper and validated bibliography you can copy and paste straight into your paper.

### Tests
````bash
make test
````

### Credits
A huge thanks to Rintze M. Zelle, Sebastian Karcher, Frank G. Bennett, Jr.,
and Bruce D'Arcus of CSL and citeproc-js for putting down so many hours of work into creating a remarkable piece of software.

I would also like to thank everyone who gave me feedback through the feedback form on the previous version of LittList. The only way to improve the software is to listen to the wants of the users.
